## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

### What

The focus of this project was to develop a practical knowledge of using modern communication interfaces, programming Atmel ATmega32 microcontroller, using C language.

### Why

In today's world, humans are surrounded by intelligent devices and devices that have a certain logic. In addition to the hardware component, every intelligent device requires software to define its operation and link the individual components of the device. 
In this work it was necessary to write software code for a real time clock based on a DS1307 sensor, the data from which is transmitted to a display equipped with a touch panel. All logic was handled by an Atmel ATmega32 microcontroller

### How

To achieve the main aim of this project I defined 4 main objectives, which were:-

1. Implement the communication between the sensor and MPU over TWI(I2c).
2. Design and write a small library to display data on the GLCD screen.
3. Implement the screen touch processing logic.
4. Test the platform's functionality by simulating in Proteus and on the real development board (EASY AVR V7).
